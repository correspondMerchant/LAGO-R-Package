}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame, Input data}

\item{outcome_name}{character, Outcome name}

\item{outcome_type}{character, Outcome type, either "continuous" or "binary"}

\item{glm_family}{character, Family for the GLM model
For example: "binomial"
For v1.1, we are only considering binomial family, and quasibinomial(link="logit")}

\item{link}{character, the link option when glm_family is set to quasibinomial.
It has to be one of the following:
logit (default), probit, cauchit, log and cloglog.}

\item{include_intercept}{boolean, Whether the intercept should be included in the
fitted model.}

\item{interventions_list}{character vector, Names of the intervention components
For example: c("component1", "component2")}

\item{center_characteristic_list}{character vector, Names of the center characteristics
For example: c("characteristic1")}

\item{center_characteristic_list_for_optimization}{numeric vector, Given values of
the center characteristics
For example: c(1.74)}

\item{intervention_lower_bounds}{numeric vector, Lower bounds for the intervention components
For example: c(0,0)}

\item{intervention_upper_bounds}{numeric vector, Upper bounds for the intervention components
For example: c(10,20)}

\item{cost_list_of_lists}{list, A nested list structure defining cost functions for the intervention components.
Each sublist represents a component and contains coefficients for its cost function.
The position of each coefficient in the sublist corresponds to the power of x in the polynomial cost function.
For example:
list(list(1, 2), list(4), list(5)) represents:
- First component: cost = 1x + 2x^2
- Second component: cost = 4x
- Third component: cost = 5x
Empty sublists are not allowed. Each component must have at least one coefficient.
For v1, we are only considering linear cost functions, more details below.}

\item{outcome_goal}{numeric, The outcome goal}

\item{outcome_goal_optimization}{character, Method used behind the scenes for
calculating the recommended interventions. Either "numerical" or "grid_search"
For v1, this does not matter since we work with linear cost functions and
we only have one way of solving for the recommended interventions}
}
\value{
List(recommended interventions, associated cost for the interventions,
estimated outcome mean/probability for the intervention group in the next stage)
}
\description{
Returns the LAGO recommended interventions for the next stage.
The recommended interventions that aim to satisfy the outcome goal and/or the
power goal.
