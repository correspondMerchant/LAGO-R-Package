\usage{
get_recommended_interventions_higher_order_cost(
  beta_vec,
  cost_list_of_lists,
  intervention_lower_bounds,
  intervention_upper_bounds,
  outcome_goal,
  outcome_goal_optimization = "numerical",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta_vec}{numeric vector, Coefficient estimates for the intervention
components, including the intercept term, but not including any coefficient
estimates for the center characteristics.
For example: c(0.1, 0.3, 0.15).
If intercept == T, then the first element 0.1 is the estimate for the intercept.}

\item{cost_list_of_lists}{A nested list structure defining cost functions for
the intervention components. Each sublist represents a component and contains
coefficients for its cost function.}

\item{intervention_lower_bounds}{numeric vector, Lower bounds for the
intervention components.
For example: c(0,0).}

\item{intervention_upper_bounds}{numeric vector, Upper bounds for the
intervention components.
For example: c(10,20).}

\item{outcome_goal}{numeric, The outcome goal.}

\item{outcome_goal_optimization}{character, Method used behind the scenes for
calculating the recommended interventions. Either "numerical" or "grid_search".}

\item{grid_search_step_size}{numeric, step size for the grid search algorithm,
default value is 0.01 for each intervention component.}

\item{center_cha_coeff_vec}{numeric vector, Coefficients estimates for the
center characteristics.
For example: c(0.2, 0.4).}

\item{center_cha}{numeric vector, Given values of the center characteristics.}

\item{intercept}{boolean, Whether the intercept was included in the fitted model.}

\item{phase}{character, Either "Planning" or "Optimal". "Planning" means
we are calculating the recommended interventions for the next stage. When the
outcome goal cannot be reached, we aim to bring the estimated outcome mean/probability
for the intervention group in the next stage to be as close to the outcome goal
as possible. "Optimal" means we are calculating the optimal interventions at the
end of the stage, using the idea from web appendix section 5.1 of Nevo et al.

For now, this defaults to "planning". we can discuss whether we need
both "Planning" and "Optimal".}

List(recommended interventions, outcome goal, and estimated outcome mean/probability

}
\description{
Calculates the LAGO recommended interventions
for the next stage based on a general cost function (not necessarily linear)
and given parameters.
The recommended interventions aim to satisfy the outcome goal and/or
the power goal.
