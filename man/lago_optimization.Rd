\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame. The input dataset containing the variables of
interest.}

\item{input_data_structure}{A character string. The data structure of the
input data. Must be either "individual_level" or "center_level".
Default value without user specification: "individual_level".}

\item{outcome_name}{A character string. The name of the column in the dataset
that represents the outcome of interest.}

\item{outcome_type}{A character string. Specifies the type of the outcome.
Must be either "continuous" for continuous outcomes or "binary" for binary
outcomes.}

\item{intervention_components}{A character vector. The names of the columns
in the dataset that represent the intervention components.
For example: c("component1", "component2").}

\item{intervention_lower_bounds}{A numeric vector. Specifies the lower bounds
of the intervention components.
For example: for a two-component intervention package, lower bounds could be
c(0,0).}

\item{intervention_upper_bounds}{A numeric vector. Specifies the upper bounds
of the intervention components.
For example: for a two-component intervention package, upper bounds could be
c(10,20).}

\item{outcome_goal}{A numeric value. Specifies the outcome goal, a desired
probability or mean value.}

\item{outcome_goal_intention}{A character string. Specifies the intention of
the outcome goal. Must be either "maximize" or "minimize". If the goal is to
increase the outcome, set it to "maximize". If the goal is to decrease the
outcome, set it to "minimize".}

\item{unit_costs}{A numeric vector. Specifies the unit costs for each
intervention component.
Default value without user specification: NULL.}

\item{default_cost_fxn_type}{A character string. Specifies the shape of the
default cost function. Must be either "linear" or "cubic".
Default value without user specification: "cubic".}

\item{cost_list_of_vectors}{A list of numeric vectors. Specifies the cost
functions for each intervention component. Each numeric vector in the list
contains coefficients of the cost function for one intervention component.
For example:
list(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(4, 6), c(5, 4, 3)) represents:
- First component: cost = 1 + 2x_1 + 3x_1^2 + 4x_1^3
- Second component: cost = 4 + 6x_2
- Third component: cost = 5 + 4x_3 + 3x_3^2
list(c(0, 2), c(0, 6), c(0, 4)) represents:
- First component: cost = 2x_1
- Second component: cost = 6x_2
- Third component: cost = 4x_3
Default value without user specification: NULL.
Please note that either the unit_costs or cost_list_of_vectors must be
specified. If both are specified, the cost_list_of_vectors will be used.}

\item{glm_family}{A character string. The family of the glm() outcome model.
Default value without user specification:
"gaussian" for continuous outcomes, "binomial" for binary outcomes.}

\item{link}{A character string. The link function of the glm() outcome model.
Default value without user specification:
"identity" for continuous outcomes, "logit" for binary outcomes.}

\item{optimization_method}{A character string. Specifies the method used for
LAGO optimization. Must be either "numerical" or "grid_search".
Default value without user specification: "numerical".
- Use "grid_search" if you want to exhaustively test every possible
intervention package compositions in LAGO optimization.
- Use "numerical" if you want to use gradient-based technique in LAGO
optimization.}

\item{confidence_set_alpha}{A numeric value. The type I error considered in
the confidence set calculations.
Default value without user specification: 0.05.}

\item{weights}{A numeric vector. The weights argument of the glm()
outcome model.}

\item{center_characteristics}{A character vector. The names of the columns in
the dataset that represent the center characteristics.
Note, include_center_effects and center_characteristics cannot be used
together at the same time.
For example: c("characteristic1")}

\item{center_characteristics_optimization_values}{A numeric vector. The
values of the center characteristics that will be used for LAGO optimization.
For example: c(1.74)}

\item{main_components}{A character vector. Specifies the main intervention
components in the presence of interaction terms.
For example: c("component1", "component2").}

\item{time_effect_optimization_value}{A numeric value. The value of the time
effect that will be used for LAGO optimization.}

\item{additional_covariates}{A character vector. The names of the columns in
the dataset that represent additional covaraites that need to be included
in the outcome model. This includes interaction terms or any other additional
covariates.
For example: c("component2xcomponent4").}

\item{center_weights_for_outcome_goal}{A numeric vector. Specifies the
weights that will be used for calculating recommended interventions that
satisfy the outcome goal for an (weighted) average center.
The weights need to sum up to 1.
Default value without user specification:
For each center, calculate what percentage its sample size is of the total
samples across all facilities - this percentage serves as that
center's weight.}

\item{optimization_grid_search_step_size}{A numeric vector. Specifies the
step size of the grid search algorithm used in LAGO optimization.
Default value without user specification:
1/20 of the range for each intervention component.}

\item{confidence_set_grid_step_size}{A numeric vector. Specifies the step
size of the grid search algorithm used in the confidence set calculation.
Default value without user specification:
1/20 of the range for each intervention component.}

\item{include_confidence_set}{A boolean. Specifies whether the confidence set
should be calculated along with the recommended interventions.
Default value without user specification: TRUE.}

\item{include_center_effects}{A boolean. Specifies whether the fixed effects
should be included in the outcome model. If set to TRUE, please make sure
that the input data has a 'center' column to identify the centers.
Note, include_center_effects and center_characteristics cannot be used
together at the same time.
Default value without user specification: FALSE for individual level data,
TRUE for center level data.}

\item{center_effects_optimization_values}{A numeric vector. The center of
interest that will be used for center-specific LAGO optimization. This is
only used when include_center_effects is set to TRUE. If not specified,
the LAGO optimization will be carried out for a weighted average of all
centers.}

\item{include_time_effects}{A boolean. Specifies whether the fixed time
effects should be included in the outcome model. If set to TRUE, please
make sure that the input data has a 'period' column to identify the time
periods.
Default value without user specification: FALSE.}

\item{include_interaction_terms}{A boolean. Specifies whether there are
interaction terms in the intervention components. Please make sure the
interaciton terms are included in "intervention_components", and they
follow the correct naming scheme: "component1:component3".
Default value without user specification: FALSE.}
