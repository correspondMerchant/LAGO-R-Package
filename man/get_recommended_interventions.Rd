\arguments{
\item{beta_vector}{A numeric vector. The coefficient estimates for the
intervention components including the intercept term
For example: c(0.1, 0.3, 0.15).}

\item{cost_list_of_vectors}{A list of numeric vectors. Specifies the cost
functions for each intervention component. Each numeric vector in the list
contains coefficients of the cost function for one intervention component.
For example:
list(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(4, 6), c(5, 4, 3)) represents:
- First component: cost = 1 + 2x_1 + 3x_1^2 + 4x_1^3
- Second component: cost = 4 + 6x_2
- Third component: cost = 5 + 4x_3 + 3x_3^2
list(c(0, 2), c(0, 6), c(0, 4)) represents:
- First component: cost = 2x_1
- Second component: cost = 6x_2
- Third component: cost = 4x_3}

\item{intervention_lower_bounds}{A numeric vector. Specifies the lower bounds
of the intervention components.
For example: for a two-component intervention package, lower bounds could be
c(0,0).}

\item{intervention_upper_bounds}{A numeric vector. Specifies the upper bounds
of the intervention components.
For example: for a two-component intervention package, upper bounds could be
c(10,20).}

\item{outcome_goal}{A numeric value. Specifies the outcome goal, a desired
probability or mean value.}

\item{optimization_method}{A character string. Specifies the method used for
LAGO optimization. Must be either "numerical" or "grid_search".
Default value without user specification: "numerical".
- Use "grid_search" if you want to exhaustively test every possible
intervention package compositions in LAGO optimization.
- Use "numerical" if you want to use gradient-based technique in LAGO
optimization.}

\item{optimization_grid_search_step_size}{A numeric vector. Specifies the
step size of the grid search algorithm used in LAGO optimization.
Default value without user specification:
1/20 of the range for each intervention component.}

\item{center_cha_coeff_vec}{A numeric vector. The coefficients estimates for
the center characteristics.
For example: c(-0.4).}

\item{center_characteristics_optimization_values}{A numeric vector. The
values of the center characteristics that will be used for LAGO optimization.
For example: c(1.74)}
