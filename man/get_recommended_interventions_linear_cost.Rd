\usage{
get_recommended_interventions_linear_cost(
  beta_vec,
  cost_coef,
  intervention_lower_bounds,
  intervention_upper_bounds,
  outcome_goal,
  center_cha_coeff_vec = 0,
  center_cha = 0,
  intercept = TRUE,
  phase = "planning"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta_vec}{numeric vector, Coefficient estimates for the intervention
components, including the intercept term, but not including any coefficient
estimates for the center characteristics.
For example: c(0.1, 0.3, 0.15).
If intercept == T, then the first element 0.1 is the estimate for the intercept.}

\item{cost_coef}{numeric vector, Coefficients for the cost functions.
For linear cost functions, one element per intervention component is required.}

\item{intervention_lower_bounds}{numeric vector, Lower bounds for the
intervention components.
For example: c(0,0).}

\item{intervention_upper_bounds}{numeric vector, Upper bounds for the
intervention components.
For example: c(10,20).}

\item{outcome_goal}{numeric, The outcome goal.}

\item{center_cha_coeff_vec}{numeric vector, Coefficients estimates for the
center characteristics.
For example: c(0.2, 0.4).}

\item{center_cha}{numeric vector, Given values of the center characteristics.}

\item{intercept}{boolean, Whether the intercept was included in the fitted model.}

\item{phase}{character, Either "Planning" or "Optimal". "Planning" means
we are calculating the recommended interventions for the next stage. When the
outcome goal cannot be reached, we aim to bring the estimated outcome mean/probability
for the intervention group in the next stage to be as close to the outcome goal
as possible. "Optimal" means we are calculating the optimal interventions at the
end of the stage, using the idea from web appendix section 5.1 of Nevo et al.

For v1, this defaults to "planning". we can discuss whether we want to keep
both "Planning" and "Optimal".}

\description{
Calculates the LAGO recommended interventions
for the next stage based on a linear cost function and given parameters.
The recommended interventions aim to satisfy the outcome goal and/or
the power goal.
