## We manually test the calculations of the recommended interventions with the BetterBirth data.

## install and Load the LAGO pacakge 
```{r}
devtools::clean_dll()
devtools::load_all()
```

## Load the BetterBirth data with EBP proportions
```{r}
# BB data has been open sourced, so it has been preloaded 
BB_proportions <- LAGO::BB_proportions
head(BB_proportions)
```

## Calculate the recommended interventions using the LAGO package 
```{r}
# using a linear cost function
optimization_results <- calculate_recommended_interventions(
                                    data = BB_proportions,
                                    outcome_name = "EBP_proportions",
                                    outcome_type = "continuous", 
                                    glm_family = "quasibinomial",
                                    link = "logit",
                                    intervention_components = c("coaching_updt", "launch_duration"),
                                    center_characteristics = c("birth_volume_100"),
                                    center_characteristics_optimization_values = 1.75,
                                    intervention_lower_bounds = c(1,1),
                                    intervention_upper_bounds = c(40, 5),
                                    cost_list_of_vectors = list(c(0, 1.7), c(0, 8)),
                                    outcome_goal = 0.8,
                                    include_confidence_set = T)
# for higher order cost, see test_higher_order_costs.Rmd 
```

## Compare with the results from Bing et al. 
```{r}
# From Bing et al paper:
# "... For a center with an average birth volume (z = 175), the estimated 
# optimal intervention package under the linear cost function comprised a launch 
# duration of 5 days and 31 coaching visits ... "
optimization_results$rec_int
# 30.52 approximates to 31, so same results as described in the paper 

# cost for the recommended interventions
optimization_results$rec_int_cost

# estimated outcome mean/probability in the next stage 
optimization_results$est_outcome_goal
