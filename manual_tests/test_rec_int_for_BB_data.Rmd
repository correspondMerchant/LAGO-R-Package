## We manually test the calculations of the recommended interventions with the BetterBirth data.

## install and Load the LAGO pacakge 
```{r}
# your path to the package tar.gz file
# install.packages("path/to/LAGO_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
library(LAGO)
```

## Load the BetterBirth data
```{r}
# BB data has been open sourced, so I pre-loaded the BB data in the LAGO package 
BB_data <- LAGO::BB_data
head(BB_data)
```

## Calculate the recommended interventions using the LAGO package 
```{r}
# Real use case. We expect this to be the user experience when 
# using this R package. 

optimization_results <- calculate_recommended_interventions(
                                    df = BB_data,
                                    outcome_name = "pp3_oxytocin_mother",
                                    outcome_type = "binary", 
                                    glm_family = "binomial",
                                    linear_cost_functions = TRUE,
                                    interventions_list = c("coaching_updt", "launch_duration"),
                                    center_characteristic_list = c("birth_volume_100"),
                                    center_characteristic_list_for_optimization = 1.75,
                                    intervention_lower_bounds = c(1,1),
                                    intervention_upper_bounds = c(40, 5),
                                    cost_list_of_lists = list(c(1.7), c(8)),
                                    outcome_goal = 0.85)
```

## Compare with the results from Nevo et al. 
```{r}
# From Nevo et al paper:
# "... we estimated the optimal intervention for a center with average 
# birth volumn (z=175) to be a launch duration of 2.78 days and 1 coaching visit."
optimization_results$rec_int
# same results as described in the paper 

# cost for the recommended interventions
optimization_results$rec_int_cost

# estimated outcome mean/probability in the next stage 
optimization_results$est_outcome_goal
