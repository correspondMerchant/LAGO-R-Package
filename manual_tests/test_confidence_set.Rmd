# cs results are the same as in Nevo et al:
# Out of 360 potential intervention packages, 38 (10.5%) were included in the
# 95% confidence set. The set included the following combinations: 1.5 days
# launch duration and 40 coaching visits; 2 days launch durations and 27 or
# more coaching visits; 2.5 days launch duration and less than 20 coaching
# visits; and 3 days launch duration and less than 5 coaching visits.
